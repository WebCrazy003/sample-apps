- create a sub-folder at Kaia.ai
- upload ./public/* to the new sub-folder
- navigate to My Apps, click New App, fill out app form and publish your new app

## Customizing NN Model
To make a custom TfLite model please follow a detailed [Google Codelabs TFLite](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets-2-tflite/index.html#0) tutorial

## TensorFlow Lite API Overview
```js
let tfLite = await createTensorFlowLite(model); // load model
let result = await tfLite.run([img], {  // classify image
  input: [{width: size, height: size, channels: 4, batchSize: 1, imageMean: 128.0, imageStd: 128.0,
           type: 'colorBitmapAsFloat'}],
  output:[{type: 'float', size: [1, 1001]}]
});
let probabilities = result.output[0][0];
