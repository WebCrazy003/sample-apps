- create a sub-folder at Kaia.ai
- upload ./public/* to the new sub-folder
- navigate to My Apps, click New App, fill out app form and publish your new app

## Customizing NN Model
To make a custom TfMobile model please follow a detailed [Google Codelabs TFMobile](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets-2/#0) tutorial

## TensorFlow Mobile API Overview
```js
let tfMobile = await createTfMobile(model); // load model
let result = await tfMobile.run([img], {    // classify image
  feed: [{width: size, height: size, inputName: 'input', imageMean: 128.0, imageStd: 128.0,
          feedType: 'colorBitmapAsFloat'}],
  run: {enableStats: false},
  fetch: {outputNames: ['MobilenetV1/Predictions/Softmax'], outputTypes: ['float']}
});
let probabilities = result.output[0];
```
